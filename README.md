# cereal-nutrition-visualization
Used to compare nutritional content of various cereal brands, especially comparing those for children vs. adults.

This visualization was part of a final project for my Data Science Master's program. The intent of the project was to understand the visualization design and review process. Read the included PDF justifying the design which identifies plenty of improvement opportunities. I hope to implement those improvements at a later date!
